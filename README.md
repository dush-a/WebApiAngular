# WebApiAngular
AngularJS 1.4.7 service accessing ASP.NET Web API 2

Related JavaScript files are in Ng folder.
app.model.js contains the app module deienition.
homeCtrl.js contains the service and the controller.

I couldn't get ProductService to work in the AngularJS controller.

Please note: Web API works well, tested using Fiddler and browser.
